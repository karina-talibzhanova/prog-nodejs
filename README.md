# Bar Crawl Planner

## Usage
* npm install, npm start
* what exactly the thing does (finds the optimal route for a bar crawl)
* briefly run through the form process (select bars, select start and end, et voila)

## API
* literally just the one GET request
* ya girl don't give a shit lol
* explain what this GET request does (finds optimal route)
* explain what it returns (JSON containing directions - only need waypoint_order)
* parameters required (start, end, waypoints(in an array))

## Client-side
* just a run-down of what index.js actually does
* explain how the API request is formatted and why
* explain the reasoning behind using coords instead of college names (hence why the map can be a bit confusing - mitigated with a list telling you the bar crawl order)
